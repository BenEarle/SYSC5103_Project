# SYSC5103_Project


The project was implemented using Jason BDI. The project was done using JEdit, an editor included with Jason. The final version was compiled to an executable file "sYSC5103_Project.jar". Also included is a script that will launch the RoboCup server, monitor, and our team of agents.
